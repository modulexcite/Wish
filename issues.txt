latest version of codebox

remove all terminal shit

tab completion doesn't work if not first arg, 
e.g. cp C:\temp>sample.in blast{Tab} does nothing

'.' only as command causes crash

rm fails for directory

probably bad to hit view model for each key stroke

Capture standard error

trying to access a directory without rights does not work and
no error is diplayed, i.e. C:\Perflogs>ls displays nothing.

Fix NavigateUp. No seriously, don't leave that pile of crap

dynamically set start directory - now will be done in WishModule

need to find way to make directories in prompt case correct,
i.e. if user enters cd c:\links, but the directory is c:\Links,
then the display should be c:\Links

Handle cd ../.. as well as cd ..\.. 

tab completion fails when prompt is working directory because
the dirString (ComMan.cs line 77) also contains the prompt.
