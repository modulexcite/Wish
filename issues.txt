Fix NavigateUp. No seriously, don't leave that pile of crap

First character of prompt (the drive) to upcase

need to find way to make directories in prompt case correct,
i.e. if user enters cd c:\links, but the directory is c:\Links,
then the display should be c:\Links

Handle cd ../.. as well as cd ..\..
